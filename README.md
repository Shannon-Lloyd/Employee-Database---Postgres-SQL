## About
Create an employee database, import data from csv files, and query the database.

## Getting Started
All necessary files are located in this sql-challenge repository. 

The EmployeeSQL folder contains a file named ERD_QuickDBD.txt which contains the text I used in QuickDBD to create a ERD for the employee database. QuickDBD-sql-challenge.png is an image of the ERD generated by QuickDBD and QuickDBD-sql-challenge.pdf is a description of the database generated with QuickDBD.

The file sql-challenge-schema.sql is the SQL code genertated by QuickDBD to create the database and set the forign keys in all tables.

The file sql-challenge-queries.sql is the SQL code for querying the database.

The csv files for importing the data into the database are in the data folder.


## Installing
This was generated using pgAdmin 4 version 7.5 on a Windows 10 Pro system.
Postgre version 14.8


## Usage
Use pgAdmin to create a new database. Open sql-challenge-schema.sql in a query window and run. This will create the data tables for the database. Import the data files to their respective tables. Open sql-challenge-schema.sql in a query window and run the individual queries to see the requested information.

Thank you to CG:AF at Central Grading for refering me to https://community.codenewbie.org/kwing25/how-to-write-a-good-readme-for-your-project-16ej. I have used this as a template instead of the template from the Gitlab repository for class. Hopefully y'all like it better.

https://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com/ was used to generate the ERD and schema SQL.
https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/ was useful for finding information on how to structure the correct queries.
